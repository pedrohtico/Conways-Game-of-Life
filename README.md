C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life with Allegro.

Screen width and height can be set at main.cpp.

Tile Size can be set in GameofLife.h, but it is necessary to update it to draw function aswell. Need to automatize.

In the same file, the probability of a given cell being alive or dead can be set. Need to define constants for it.
